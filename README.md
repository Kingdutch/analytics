# alexandervarwijk.com / Analytics

This repository contains the analytics code for [my personal website](https://www.alexandervarwijk.com/).

The analytics code is inspired by [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) to track only anonymised
data and not perform any invasive user tracking.

For development, this project can be set up locally by using `yarn` to install
the dependencies. Starting docker will set up a local webserver and node 
container that sets up webpack to watch the source files and nodemon to 
automatically restart the server if anything changes.
